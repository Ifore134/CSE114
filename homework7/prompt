The prompt for this assignment was:

1. (HexFormatException) Implement the parseHex that transforms from hexadecimal to decimal method to throw a 
NumberFormatException if the string is NOT a hex string. Define a custom exception called HexFormatException.

2. Write an abstract superclass encapsulating a college applicant: A college applicant has two attributes: the applicant's name 
and the college the applicant is applying to. This class has two non-abstract subclasses: one encapsulating an applicant for undergraduate school, 
and the other encapsulating an applicant for graduate school. An applicant for undergraduate school has two additional attributes: an SAT score 
and a GPA. An applicant for graduate school has one additional attribute: the college of origin. It also has a method that returns "from inside" 
if the college of origin is the same as the college applied to; otherwise, it returns "from outside." You also need to include a class to test these classes.

3. (Enable GeometricObject comparable) Modify the GeometricObject class to implement the Comparable interface, and define a static max
method in the GeometricObject class for finding the larger of two GeometricObject objects. Draw the UML diagram and implement the new 
GeometricObject class. Write a test program that uses the max method to find the larger of two circles and the larger of two rectangles.

4. (Enable GeometricObject cloneable) Modify the GeometricObject class to implement the Cloneable interface. 
Draw the UML diagram and implement the new GeometricObject class. Write a test program that uses the clone method to copy a rectangle.
